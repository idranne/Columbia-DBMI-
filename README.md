# Project Background and Motivation
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily of the central nervous system affecting both motor and non-motor systems. It's an age-related degenerative brain condition, meaning that is causes parts of the brain to detetoriate. It's motor symptoms are characterized by slowed movements, tremoto rs while muscles are at rest, rigidity/stiffness, unstable posture or walking gait, blinking less than usual, cramped handwriting, drooling, soft speaking voice. There's a lot of research going on about how to mitigate the progression of PD and enhance early diagnosis. Most of times, PD patients are diagnosed late and symptoms are misdiagnosed with other diseases, posing a problem for patients Currently, there's no cure for PD even though there are several treatments available to patients.

The field of mobile health and digital healthcare technology have evolved to develop sensors that could detect PD from biomarkers collected from passive sensing data e.g smartwatches, Apple watches, movement apps, which monitors the patients daily and collect information in real-time

# Summer Research Project
This summer project aims to use machine learning / deep learning algorithms to build a multimodal app (ParkAssist) that collects a variety of metrics from the user such as facial expression, sound recordings, typing /handwritten datasets, movements which are predictive for PD. In addtion the app would take into account the gene expression of patients which would be helpful for early PD diagnosis. By harnessing the power of passive data and gene expression, ParkAssist will enhance early PD detection and diagnosis

# Datasets I will be using
I've sourced several datasets
